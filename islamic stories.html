Creation of the world 
‎
‎The Quran provides a unique perspective on the creation of the universe, emphasizing the power and wisdom of Allah. According to Islamic belief, the universe was created in six days, with each day representing a phase or epoch rather than a 24-hour period.
‎
‎*Key Quranic Verses:*
‎
‎- *Unity of the Universe*: The heavens and earth were initially one entity, then separated. "Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were ˹once˺ one mass then we split them apart?" (Quran 21:30)
‎- *Creation from Smoke*: The universe began as a gaseous mass or smoke. "Then He turned to the heaven when it was smoke..." (Quran 41:11)
‎- *Expansion of the Universe*: The universe is constantly expanding. "And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander." (Quran 51:47)
‎- *Purpose of Creation*: The universe serves as a sign of Allah's existence and attributes, encouraging reflection and gratitude ¹ ² ³.
‎
‎*Islamic Scholars' Insights:*
‎
‎- *Al-Ghazali*: Believed that reflecting on creation strengthens faith and deepens spiritual understanding.
‎- *Al-Biruni*: Investigated astronomy and geology, finding correlations with Quranic insights.
‎- *Ibn Sina*: Viewed the universe as a manifestation of Allah's attributes, encouraging the pursuit of knowledge ¹.
‎
‎*Scientific Alignments:*
‎
‎The Quran's descriptions of the universe's creation and expansion align with modern scientific theories, such as the Big Bang theory. The Quran mentions ³ ² ¹:
‎- *Big Bang-like Event*: The universe began from a single point and expanded rapidly.
‎- *Cosmic Evolution*: The universe underwent stages of development, with galaxies and stars forming over time.
‎
‎*Hadith and Islamic History:*
‎
‎While the provided information focuses on Quranic verses, Islamic history and Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad) also contain references to the creation of the universe. However, the Quran remains the primary source for understanding Islamic beliefs about creation ⁴.
