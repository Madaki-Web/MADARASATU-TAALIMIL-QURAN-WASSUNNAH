<h3>History</h3>

<p>Madarasatul-Ta’alimil-Qur’an-was-Sunnah was founded through the efforts and dedication of Malam Abdulkadir Muhammad Ndatsu, <br>
     whose Ta’aleemat (Islamic lectures) at Masjid Ja’afar Mahmud Adam in Kwasau, Dutsen Kurangwari, <br>
      inspired its establishment.

By Allah’s will, these lectures attracted many people,<br> including some who had previously held misguided beliefs but were rightly guided through his teaching. <br> 
This impact moved the community to propose the creation of an Islamiyya school within the mosque, to promote Sunnah and
 provide children with sound Islamic upbringing—especially since Sunnah-based Islamiyya schools were few in the area. <br>

Responding to this call, Malam Abdulkadir established the school on 5th February 2011 with on
ly seven children and five adults as its pioneer students.</p>




<h3>Growth and Development</h3>
<ul>
<li>2011: Established with children’s classes (4:00 pm – 6:00 pm) and adults’ classes (Maghrib – Isha’i).</li>

<li>2014: Introduction of the Married Women’s Section, with classes held from 2:00 pm – 4:00 pm.</li></ul>

<p>Subsequent years: Expansion from mosque-based lessons to dedicated 
     classrooms due to increased enrollment.  <br>


Today, the Islamiyya has grown to accommodate over 700 students, spread across its three sections:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Children’s Section</li>


<li>Adults’ Section</li>


<li>Married Women’s Section</li>


</ol>

</p>
